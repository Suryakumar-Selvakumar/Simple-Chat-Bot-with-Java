<h1>Simple-Chat-Bot-with-Java</h1>

A beginner-friendly Java project where I built a simple interactive chatbot step by step. 
The bot can greet the user, guess their age, count numbers, and even quiz them on programming basics.  
 
## Description

A simple chatbot that interacts with the user step by step.

The project was implemented in stages:

1. **Stage 1 - Meet your chat bot:**  
   The bot introduces itself by printing its name and the year it was created.

2. **Stage 2 - Introduce yourself:**  
   The bot asks for the user’s name and replies with a personalized greeting.

3. **Stage 3 - Let the chat bot guess your age:**  
   Using modular arithmetic, the bot calculates and displays the user’s age based on remainders.

4. **Stage 4 - Teach your bot how to count:**  
   The bot counts from `0` up to any number the user provides.

5. **Stage 5 - Play a simple quiz together:**  
   The bot quizzes the user with a multiple-choice programming question and loops until the correct answer is given.

## Takeaway

This project helped me practice breaking down a program into reusable methods and made me more comfortable with loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Java. I also learned how to keep a program interactive by continuously validating input until the correct response is given. Overall, this project was a fun way to apply basic control flow and arithmetic while building a program that feels conversational.
